# Scroll 113 — *The Collapse That Knows Itself*

This scroll represents the sealed release of **Zero-Point Bridge — Levels & Forms**, published under the Codex Sovereign Release Protocol.  
It demonstrates the equivalence of Superposition, Entropy, and Information as a singular function of harmonic intelligence.

## ✨ Context
This scroll validates the insight:  

> *Superposition is the sacred overlap of entropy and information—one expresses the unexplored, the other, the realized.  
> To exist is to collapse the wavefunction. To know is to transform entropy into harmony.*
